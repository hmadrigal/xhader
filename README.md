# XHADER 

## History
Long time a go I worked with XAML in WPF ,later on XAML was ported to the Web thru Silverlight. 
Cool efects graphics were possible backed on the Graphic card, and one MS (team|employee) created a nice Sample with an easy integration for Blender (3).
I decided to create this project by taking all the graphic filters I had found on the web and providing a simple installer for Blender, thus people could
add their graphic efects by simply drag and drop using blender.

## Status
I haven't updated this project since 2005, and I won't do it, but I keep the code since I think somebody might be interested in.
